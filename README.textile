h3. Element Controls

Somewhat abstract, yet convenient module for making elements act as controls
for other elements. To create a control, just give an element the class
name "control" then give it an id that will describe its action.

For example:
<pre>
  <a href="#" id="show_menu" class="control">Show the menu</a>
  <ul id="menu" style="display:none">
    <li>Option 1</li>
    <li>Option 2</li>
    <li>Option 3</li>
    <li><a href="#" id="hide_menu" class="control">Cancel</a></li>
  </ul>
</pre>
In the above example, the "show_menu" link, when clicked, will show the ul
with the id of "menu". Clicking the "hide_menu" link will hide it again.

To create an element that controls itself, use the special word "self" instead
of a target element's id attribute. When clicked, the following element will be 
highlighted, assuming the script.aculo.us effects.js library has been included:
<pre>
  <a href="#" id="highlight_self" class="control">Highlight Me</a>
</pre>
This script has one more trick. You can create controls that perform multiple
actions by splitting the commands with "_and_". Longer ids tend to get ugly with
this syntax, but it works well if your ids are short and sweet.

Example:
<pre>
  <div id="options">
    <a href="#" id="show_menu_and_hide_options" class="control">Show the menu</a>
  </div>
  <ul id="menu" style="display:none">
    <li>Option 1</li>
    <li>Option 2</li>
    <li>Option 3</li>
    <li><a href="#" id="hide_menu_and_show_options" class="control">Cancel</a></li>
  </ul>
</pre>
Note: Unfortunately, this syntax means you'll run into trouble if you have any elements
that have ids that include the substring '_and_'. To get around this problem, you can 
disable support for multiple actions by setting the @Element.Controls.disableMultiple@ 
option to true.
